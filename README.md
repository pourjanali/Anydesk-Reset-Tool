# 🔧 Anydesk Reset Tool
A simple, clean, and effective tool to **reset AnyDesk application settings** on Windows.

This repository provides a lightweight batch script (`anydesk.bat`) that completely resets AnyDesk by removing cached configuration files, temp data, and common leftover settings — useful for:

- Fixing connection issues  
- Cleaning corrupted configs  
- Resetting forgotten settings  
- Preparing a computer for a new user  
- Tech support & troubleshooting  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✔ Fully automated reset  
- ✔ No installation needed  
- ✔ Works on all Windows versions  
- ✔ Safe to run — recreates only necessary folders  
- ✔ Lightweight and open-source  

---

## 📁 What the Script Does
The batch tool automatically:

1. Stops the AnyDesk service (if running)  
2. Deletes configuration folders  
3. Clears cache & temporary files  
4. Resets registry values connected to AnyDesk  
5. Restarts clean instance on next open without losing data and sessions

---

## 📥 How to Use
1. Download the repository or just the `anydesk.bat` file  
2. **Right-click → Run as Administrator**  
3. Wait until the script finishes  
4. Reopen AnyDesk — it will behave like a fresh install without losing data and sessions

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Your **previous configuration will be removed**  
- You will need to re-enter your AnyDesk settings after reset  
- This does **NOT** remove the AnyDesk program itself
